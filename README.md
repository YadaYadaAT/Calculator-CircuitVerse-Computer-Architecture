# Calculator-CircuitVerse-Computer-Architecture

Computer Architecture.

  Main goal was to create a simple calculator in circuitVerse. More specifically our team (Iro Ververaki , Anastasia kouridaki , Giorgos Kokkinos and John balasis) had to create a calculator that will only do addition and multiplication of unsigned intergers from 0 to 255 . In addition , the calculator should give error and operations. Each member of YadaYada team worked on different components such as half/full addition , shifter , Digit decoder , Alu e.t.c . Having already discussed in multiple meetings our main framework we ended up combine these components , apply error testing and optimize our calculator.

  Work in progress...
